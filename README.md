Impress your friends by cheating at Countdown...

Simply create a PostgreSQL database using the db-init.sql file in the db-migrations folder, then clone the git repo at https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/english-words.git to get a list of English words. Change the database.ini file to match your DB parameters and then load the english wordset into the DB using the loadwords python script. Run findwords.py to enter your 9 letters and get back a list of possible solutions.

Bingo, you're an octo-champ!
